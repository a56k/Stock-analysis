# VBA Challenge Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
###Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose is to understand the internal language of VBA to enhance the written code and decrease the time target to run our analysis. Additionally, based on a refactored approach using the same Excel model used during the module, we focus on factors that will affect the run time FY2017 & FY20, such as adding variables, formatting, running “for loops” to achieve the desired outlook.

## Analysis and Challenges
###Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


As you’ll notice in the 2017 analysis of the provided stocks workbook, multiple stocks are overperforming. Many reasons can be attributed to this bull market in 2017-  as the year received optimistic news based on the incoming president's regulations. To name a few, the new administration promised to boost the economy, invest in the local manufacturing, and took other measures such as tax cuts, international trade deals - which had a direct cause/effect of benefiting investors.

IIn contrast, the analysis FY2018 shows a sharper decrease in return year over year since 2017. Notice, only two of the analyzed stocks are performing in the positive. Some analysts have attributed this change to an inevitable correction to end the bull market. Therefore,   investors took notice and started selling to collect capital gains over their recent investments. The correction and fear of recession did drive fear through the stock market, thus explaining the sudden shift and decrease of yearly returns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Non-refactored times
Non-Refactored time
As shown in the resource folder, the VBA code's total time varies between 2017 & 2018. Using the current analysis, the difference may be due to the addition of different macros in our first analysis- which subsequentially decreased the execution time. It looped through all the modules available to provide the desired outcome. Therefore, as VBA ran the code to obtain data between rows and columns and respond to the multiple macros “Sub” modules in 2018 is significantly higher than that of 2017. Another reason for the higher time in 2017 is the changes and modifications brought to the macros in VBA to obtain the data for 2017. Those changes will certainly cause a delay in time.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Refactored times


By refactoring, we had a set plan provided in the “Module2_VBA_Script”. The guided script helped structure how to approach the challenge; therefore,  eliminated unnecessary steps within our syntax. Doing so shredded ½ of seconds to the run time and provided an efficient method to analyze all stocks for both years at once. Reusing the code helped in this process as the changes were minimal.

## Results

###3.    Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

##1.    What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Advantages of refactoring are improving the syntax, running a more efficient code, pinpointing the bugs, and enhancing the run time for multiple analyses.In contrast, refactoring creates disadvantages regarding time efficiency if the analysis takes too long to run and can be confusing to someone unfamiliar with a certain project.


##2.    How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

This method works best with a game plan to follow and comments to explain the steps to arrive at an answer. Doing so provide clarity to the entire project and
